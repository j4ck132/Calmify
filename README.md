An estimated of 50 million Americans struggled with mental illnesses in 2020; and that number has only grown because of the pandemic with 36% of Americans suffering from continued loneliness. Despite the alarming rates, many factors including stigmatization and financial issues hinder individuals from seeking help. We wanted to give these individuals an easy home solution, and through Calmify, a unique stream of consciousness journaling app, we endeavor to help struggling individuals through exciting new ideas, like a.i. detection of negative emotions and happy memory recall, which has been shown to improve mood and emotions. The app detects loneliness and other negative emotions in journaling, which it addresses with its unique modules: memory lane, AI chatting, and more.
